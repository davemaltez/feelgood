					          <p>
					            Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.
					            Happy people realize happiness is a choice. They are not held hostage by their circumstances and they do not seek happiness in people or possessions. They understand that when we stop chasing the worlds definition of happiness, we begin to see the decision to experience happiness has been right in front of us all along.
					          </p>
					           <p>
					            Simply knowing that happiness is a choice is not enough. Fully experiencing it still requires a conscience decision to do so each day.

							    <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Count your blessings.</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Happy people choose to focus on the positive aspects of life rather than the negative. They set their minds on specific reasons to be grateful. They express it when possible. And they quickly discover there is always, always, something to be grateful for.</p></div>
							    </li>
							    <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Carry a smile.</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>A smile is a wonderful beautifier. But more than that, studies indicate that making an emotion-filled face carries influence over the feelings processed by the brain. Our facial expression can influence our brain in just the same way our brains influence our face. In other words, you can actually program yourself to experience happiness by choosing to smile. Not to mention, all the pretty smiles you’ll receive in return for flashing yours is also guaranteed to increase your happiness level.</p></div>
							    </li>
							    <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Speak daily affirmations into your life.</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Affirmations are positive thoughts accompanied with affirmative beliefs and personal statements of truth. They are recited in the first person, present tense (“I am…”). Affirmations used daily can release stress, build confidence, and improve outlook. For maximum effectiveness, affirmations should be chosen carefully, be based in truth, and address current needs. Here is a list of 100 daily affirmations to help you get started.</p></div>
							    </li>
							    <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Wake up on your terms</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Most of us have alarm clocks programmed because of the expectations of others: a workplace, a school, or a waking child. That’s probably not going to change. But that doesn’t mean we have to lose control over our mornings in the process. Wake up just a little bit early and establish an empowering, meaningful, morning routine. Start each day on your terms. The next 23 hours will thank you for it.</p></div>
							    </li>
							    <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Hold back a complaint</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The next time you want to lash out in verbal complaint towards a person, a situation, or yourself, don’t. Instead, humbly keep it to yourself. You’ll likely diffuse an unhealthy, unhappy environment. But more than that, you’ll experience joy by choosing peace in a difficult situation.</p></div>
							    </li>
							     <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Practice one life-improving discipline</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>There is happiness and fulfillment to be found in personal growth. To know that you have intentionally devoted time and energy to personal improvement is one of the most satisfying feelings you’ll ever experience. Embrace and practice at least one act of self-discipline each day. This could be exercise, budgeting, or guided-learning… whatever your life needs today to continue growing. Find it. Practice it. Celebrate it.</p></div>
							    </li>
							    <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Use your strenghts</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Each of us have natural talents, strengths, and abilities. And when we use them effectively, we feel alive and comfortable in our skin. They help us find joy in our being and happiness in our design. So embrace your strengths and choose to operate within your giftedness each day. If you need to find this outlet outside your employment, by all means, find this outlet.</p></div>
							    </li>
							     <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Accomplish one important task.</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Because happy people choose happiness, they take control over their lives. They don’t make decisions based on a need to pursue joy. Instead, they operate out of the satisfaction they have already chosen. They realize there are demands on their time, helpful pursuits to accomplish, and important contributions to make to the world around them. Choose one important task that you can accomplish each day. And find joy in your contribution.</p></div>
							    </li>
							     <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Eat a healthy meal/snack.</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>We are spiritual, emotional, and mental beings. We are also physical bodies. Our lives cannot be wholly separated into its parts. As a result, one aspect always influences the others. For example, our physical bodies will always have impact over our spiritual and emotional well-being. Therefore, caring for our physical well-being can have significant benefit for our emotional standing. One simple action to choose happiness today is to eat healthy foods. Your physical body will thank you… and so will your emotional well-being.</p></div>
							    </li>	
							     <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Treat others well.</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Everyone wants to be treated kindly. But more than that, deep down, we also want to treat others with the same respect that we would like given to us. Treat everyone you meet with kindness, patience, and grace. The Golden Rule is a powerful standard. It benefits the receiver. But also brings growing satisfaction in yourself as you seek to treat others as you would like to be treated.</p></div>
							    </li>	
							     <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Meditate.</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Find time alone in solitude. As our world increases in speed and noise, the ability to withdraw becomes even more essential. Studiesconfirm the importance and life-giving benefits of meditation. So take time to make time. And use meditation to search inward, connect spiritually, and improve your happiness today</p></div>
							    </li>   
							     <li>
							      <div class="collapsible-header">Search for benefit in your pain.</div>
							      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>This life can be difficult. Nobody escapes without pain. At some point—in some way—we all encounter it. When you do, remind yourself again that the trials may be difficult, but they will pass. And search deep to find meaning in the pain. Choose to look for the benefits that can be found in your trial. At the very least, perseverance is being built. And most likely, an ability to comfort others in their pain is also being developed.</p></div>
